# I will need to cluster the masts that belong to the same semantic

# First measure:  Distribution of distance to mast for stop segments
# Second measure: Topological distance between the real cell of a stop and
#                 the connected mast --> difficult --> forget for now
# Third measure:  Csaj-Approach: double the distance between the mast from the
#                 active voronoi cell and see whether the active mast is in
#                 that set.
